<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>

- **Operating System:** Windows 7 or later / Linux / macOS
- **Spotify Client:** [Official Spotify Desktop Application](https://loadspot.pages.dev) (Microsoft Store version not supported)
- **PowerShell:** Version 5.1 or higher (Windows only)
- **Bash Shell:** Required for Linux and macOS installations
- **Internet Connection:** Required for installation and updates

<h1 id="perks">Why SpotFreedom?</h1>

SpotFreedom uses BlockTheSpot (https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot) as its core ad-blocking technology, with exclusive features designed for advanced users:

- **🚫 BlockTheSpot Integration:** Uses the proven DLL injection method from BlockTheSpot for superior ad-blocking.
- **🔄 Automatic Update Checking:** Verifies the latest Spotify version from loadspot.pages.dev to ensure patches remain compatible.
- **🌍 Built-in Proxy/VPN Support:** Easily configure proxies to bypass geo-restrictions directly via installation parameters (Windows only).
- **🎨 Seamless Spicetify Integration:** Automatically install or update Spicetify alongside your patches with the simple `-spicetify` switch (Windows only).
- **🛡️ Enhanced Stability:** Uses local patching methods to reduce reliance on external servers for patch data.
- **🧹 Auto-Cleanup:** Automatically manages and cleans up temporary files (`SpotFreedom_Temp`) for a cleaner system.

<h1 id="features">Features</h1>

- **Blocks all banner, video, and audio ads** in the client
- **Hiding podcasts, episodes, and audiobooks** from the homepage (optional)
- **Block Spotify automatic updates** (optional)
- **Automatic version checking** from loadspot.pages.dev to ensure compatibility with the latest Spotify version
- **Built-in Proxy/VPN Support** including Outline VPN (Windows only)
- **Spicetify Integration** (Windows only)
- **BlockTheSpot Integration** (Enabled by default, uses DLL injection from https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot)
- **Some native experimental features have been changed**
- **Advanced installation [parameters](https://github.com/SpotX-Official/SpotX/discussions/60)**

> **Note on BlockTheSpot:**
> BlockTheSpot (DLL Injection) is now **enabled by default** as the primary ad-blocking method. This provides enhanced ad-blocking capabilities using the proven approach from https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot. If you experience issues or prefer the native binary patching method instead, you can disable BlockTheSpot by running the installer with the `-no_bts` parameter.
>
> **Automatic Updates:** This repository is automatically monitored for BlockTheSpot updates. When a new version is released, a pull request is automatically created to track the update.
